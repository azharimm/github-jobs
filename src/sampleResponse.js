Are you looking for an international and fast-paced yet collaborative environment to thrive in?</p>\n<p>You have come to the right place.</p>\n<p>CitizenLab is a Brussels-based social impact scale-up that aims to improve democracy for the digital era. The SaaS platform is already being used by 125 cities and municipalities in 8 different countries, facilitating two-way communication between local governments and its citizens. Since it was founded in 2015, CitizenLab gave 250.000 citizens a direct voice in local politics and got recognized as 'Best Social Impact Startup in Europe'. After recently having raised a significant funding round, CitizenLab is looking for mission-driven talent to join on its mission to have 2,5 million citizens actively participate via its e-democracy platforms in cities all over the world.</p>\n<h2>Full-Stack Engineer at CitizenLab</h2>\n<p>As a Full-Stack Engineer in our Engagement squad, you focus on the core product which allows local governments to engage their citizens through a wide range of digital participation methods. You’ll work both on our back-end APIs, which are mostly written in Ruby, and our front-ends, which are mostly written in React and TypeScript. Ideally, you know both stacks, but you are at least proficient in React and are experienced with a similar framework like Ruby on Rails for the other.</p>\n<p>As someone with the overview, you’ll help front-end developers understand the back-end challenges and vice versa. You’re always helping to smooth out the unknowns between both worlds.</p>\n<p>At CitizenLab, we work in small teams where members collectively take ownership of the outcome of the features they build. Engineers don’t merely implement specifications, but are empowered to come up with solutions, in close collaboration with their peers and with direct exposure to the end user. We work in very small iterations and release continuously. We’re strong believers in automated testing and code reviews. We automate as much as we can.</p>\n<h2>What do we expect from you?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You have multiple years of experience in building end-to-end web applications.</li>\n<li>You’re experienced in React, preferably with Typescript.</li>\n<li>You have worked with Ruby and Ruby on Rails before.</li>\n<li>You like to think along and collaborate on the solution, not just on the implementation.</li>\n<li>You know how to implement a modern user interface.</li>\n<li>You know how to implement a sound API.</li>\n<li>You’re an excellent communicator and are effective in bridging knowledge gaps between front-end and back-end engineers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What can you expect from us?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlock your full potential and have an impact at scale. We're daily working with +125 governments to connect them to their citizens.</li>\n<li>Have the opportunity to explore new technologies, as we're currently doing with Elixir.</li>\n<li>Become a key factor in our rapid transition from startup (15 employees) to scaleup (35 employees).</li>\n<li>Work in a fast-paced, collaborative and supportive environment—right in the heart of Brussels.</li>\n<li>Be part of our dynamic international team. We organise many team activities and go for lots of spontaneous after-works... which inevitably turn into political discussions after two beers—that's an interest we all share. :)</li>\n<li>Informal work vibe with open communication and full transparency on results.</li>\n<li>Participate in inspiring team lunches, bi-quarterly strategic town halls, bi-yearly off-site team retreats.</li>\n<li>Receive a competitive salary package, incl. perks such as 26 paid holidays, your own laptop, flexibility on working from home, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CitizenLab is committed to being a diverse and inclusive workplace. We encourage applicants of different backgrounds, cultures, genders, experiences, abilities and perspectives to apply.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Paxos was founded in 2012 as the first institutional and regulated crypto-exchange, our founding team quickly realized there was an opportunity to establish ourselves as the trusted leader in digital assets. By creating regulated digital assets like our USD-backed stablecoin PAX, we’re giving customers the chance to process their financial transactions in safer, faster and more cost-effective ways. We’re also building solutions for some of the world’s best-known financial institutions to settle day-to-day transactions faster, cheaper and with the most modern technology. We believe the global financial system has relied too long on closed infrastructure and outdated technologies - it's time for a change.</p>\n<p>We are looking for an Engineering Manager to join our rapidly growing FinTech company. This role will be reporting directly to the SVP of Engineering and will have a huge impact on the technical direction of the entire company. This includes providing architectural guidance, mentoring other engineers, evaluating new technologies and industry changes, and defining and leading company best practices. This will also include interfacing with other leading technology companies and universities in the future of the blockchain industry.</p>\n<p>What you will do:\nYou will produce a work output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into sub-tasks, and delegating and completing the sub-tasks with relative ease – own design, coding, testing all the way through deployment of each of those sub-tasks.\nYou will build and lead a strong team of junior and senior software engineers and participate in code reviews resulting in up leveling the skill sets for the team as a whole.\nYou will identify and proactively tackle technical debt before it grows into something that requires significant up-front work to resolve. A rule of thumb is to start looking into root cause of issues whenever there is noise. There is no smoke without fire.\nYou will strike the right balance between fixing the problem at hand and focusing on finding the root cause of the problem. For example, if it’s a production issue the priority is to fix the immediate problem and collect all the data necessary for root cause analysis. In a non-production environment, the focus should be on finding the root cause and fixing it the right way to make sure the problem doesn’t occur again.\nYou'll work cross-functionally across Product, Engineering and Operations business units\nWhat you need to have:\nSignificant technical experience building business-critical software applications\nYears of people management experience, including hiring and developing engineering talent\nThe ability to work in a fast-paced, agile, and (sometimes) ambiguous environment with multiple priorities and stakeholders\nHands on software development experience (“player coach”) and are comfortable writing code\nHave worked in different technical stacks in the past with full-stack exposure (front end, back end, database), with a continuous development/continuous deployment pipeline, possibly in a 24/7 support environment\nOther than these qualifications, we're hoping to bring someone on board who loves what they do and can't wait to join an amazing team!</p>\n<p>Who we are: We are a diverse group of individuals with backgrounds and experience in banking, startups, tech giants, and big-five consulting firms. We currently have about 110 employees across offices in New York, London and Singapore and have big plans for our growth. We’re looking for collaborative, creative, hard-working and intellectually curious people to help us make our vision a reality.</p>\n<p>Why we matter: Paxos is the only technology company building financial services solutions that both customers and regulators can trust. We’re committed to pushing the boundaries of technology while also working with important stakeholder groups so we can build a financial system that is open and accessible to anyone around the world.</p>\n<p>Who are our customers: Our customers run the gamut from individuals seeking access to digital assets and those who don’t want to be tied to a physical banking system, to large institutions seeking to improve their settlement infrastructure. Some of our clients today include big names like Credit Suisse, Societe Generale, Macquarie, INTL FCStone and Virtu.</p>\n<p>How we work: Paxos is driven by our four values. We believe that every Paxos employee is an owner, and employees consistently search for the truth in their work. We also believe in real-time candor and a shared commitment to excellence. These values are ingrained in everything we do and influence how we communicate and collaborate as an organization.</p>\n<p>Why we are a great place to work:  Paxos has been consistently named a Best Place to Work by BuiltIn. We offer all of the usual startup stuff like healthy snacks, coffee, and ping pong but we also offer generous healthcare coverage, PTO, and family leave. (We want employees to care for themselves both in and out of office.) In addition to the benefits and perks, Paxos offers employees the chance to have a real and measurable impact on a growing business: what you do today directly influences the Company goals. As a result, we enable every employee to substantially grow their careers.</p>\n<p>Paxos is an equal opportunity employer. It does not discriminate on the basis of sex, age, color, race, religion, marital status, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, physical and mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran status or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law.</p>\n",

You must be based within the UK and have a valid right to work. We are unable to offer sponsorship at the time</em>\n<strong>Agencies: please kindly note that we have a select list of partners with whom we already work</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>This isn’t just another tech start-up looking for another software engineer…</strong>\nFirstly, we’re not just any tech start-up (actually, 8 years down the line, we’re more of a scale-up now). At Gecko, we’re the proud creators of a meaningful SaaS solution that has allowed today's Higher Ed institutions to connect with over 6 million students worldwide.</p>\n<p>And we’re not looking for ‘just’ another software engineer; we don’t just employ skills or qualifications - although, often they are handy, albeit even necessary. Instead, our hiring approach is always centred around finding our next ‘Gecko’.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a ‘Gecko’?</strong>\nAlthough we’re massively into automation, we are humans - not Bots! Each Gecko brings a different perspective, a solution-orientated mindset and not to mention their own “je ne sais quoi”. It's ambition, drive and curiosity all rolled into an individual who doesn’t just have the ability, but also the personality and the potential (but no egos allowed).</p>\n<p>You won't only be part of the Engineering team but the whole Gecko team; Product Managers, Designers, Customer Success people... Working with the whole Gecko team across a pretty flat hierarchy means that every Gecko is empowered to input ideas on how we can improve anything and everything – from our products, systems and processes to large-scale company-wide decisions (including the important ones like where we used to order lunch).</p>\n<p>In our Engineering team, we’re on that path of constantly trying to get better at what we do and love to share whatever we learn along the way; whether it's quirky resources, the latest tools, new languages (or even a new cooking recipe). We love to get excited about great code and can appreciate awesome craftmanship. Our projects also include a bit of something for everyone; from legacy code to greenfield, spread across two main product suites incorporating a diverse tech stack. We like to experiment; failing fast and learning faster mean that, in our Agile world, making mistakes isn’t a bad thing. We are also big advocates of paired programming and nothing is released until we have a code review and it is properly tested (we value working software over comprehensive documentation).</p>\n<p><strong>We’re looking for that true Node.js expert…</strong>\nThat’s someone who exemplifies the highest standard in software engineering and the potential to do great things with this. Someone who ensures that the team’s decisions and output consistently help empower our customers and strengthen our engineering capability.</p>\n<p>Some of the other things you’ll be doing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborating when designing and implementing low-latency, high availability and performant software across two-week sprint cycles.</li>\n<li>Being a true codebase whizz, providing technical direction and sharing knowledge of how to design features around our codebase across the team.</li>\n<li>Consistently delivering high-quality code; maintaining code quality across the team by regularly conducting code reviews.</li>\n<li>Being a highly experienced, senior engineer, you will naturally step up when needed; mentoring junior team members, confidently stepping in and assisting the Lead and VP in facilitating our Agile ceremonies and helping to build on an amazing engineering culture.</li>\n<li>Implementing and maintaining our critical security and data protection protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we’re looking for someone who truly is excited by all of this and feels passionate about the thought of building the best student engagement platform using the best technologies.</p>\n<p>Success in this role will lead to potential opportunities for growth across the entire engineering team with significant scope for future development.</p>\n<p>But enough about us, more about you...\nRequirements</p>\n<p><strong>This job might be for you if:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have super-strong expertise in Node.js, its ecosystem and ES6 – it’s your bread and butter.</li>\n<li>You understand and can demonstrate the nature of functional and asynchronous programming.</li>\n<li>You’re all over fundamental design principles behind scalable applications.</li>\n<li>You get excited about creating database schemas that represent and support business processes.</li>\n<li>You work with code versioning tools such as Git.</li>\n<li>Facilitating key team activities and supporting Leads and your team has your name written all over it!</li>\n<li>With a real passion for problem-solving, your solution-centric mindset allows you to think creatively which means you are able to come up with solid technical solutions to novel ideas &amp; challenges which arise from business as it scales</li>\n<li>Being naturally curious and an active learner, you are always learning and get excited by working collaboratively with those around you. You also like to share this knowledge and help others grow as much as you can (there’s no “I” in team, as they say)</li>\n<li>You’re ambitious and driven – you want to grow personally and professionally.</li>\n<li>You are a true Gecko at heart; you just didn’t know it yet! You want to make that move to become part of something which matters to you and where you’re valued in return.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We’d be over the moon if you also had:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise in working with Agile Development Methodologies.</li>\n<li>Already worked with and developed Microservices and Message-Orientated Service-Orientated Architectures.</li>\n<li>Involvement with Docker or container orchestration tools.</li>\n<li>Encountered continuous integration and continuous delivery.</li>\n<li>Familiarity with AWS, React, React Native, PHP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Join Gecko?</strong>\nWhy not? Joining Gecko, you will have the opportunity to learn from and work alongside some of the most passionate and driven people in the industry. Equally, this exciting time for Gecko presents a unique opportunity to embed yourself into the business at this early stage and to grow and develop as the Company grows.</p>\n<p>Our platform of market-leading EdTech products are used by Higher Ed institutions across the world to improve the way they recruit students, drive efficiencies in inquiry acquisition and increase conversion rates. Our software has helped universities connect with over 6 million students worldwide, whether they’re capturing inquiries at recruitment fairs in far-flung corners of the globe, registering attendees on to campus tours, or helping freshmen navigate the new world of higher education, our customers trust us to help deliver a great experience for their students. Oh, and we built our very own (and very clever) ChatBot too - did we mention that?</p>\n<p>We're growing fast; in fact, in the last 12 months alone we doubled our headcount, managing 100+ clients across the globe. We’ve got big plans for our leading EdTech products, but we also like to have fun; and lots of it. But like many other businesses across the globe this year, we've had to adapt from life in our colourful modern Edinburgh New Town office to a remote, home-working setup. So, we've purposely tried to continue the traditions or rituals in a virtual setting, such as 'Friday pub', 'coffees' or 'meditation sessions', as well as creating whole new ones like our new fitness channel or games nights.</p>\n<p>Some other nice things about working for Gecko (apart from the fact we're all just really nice people) include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive Salary + Commission</li>\n<li>MacBook Pro</li>\n<li>Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones</li>\n<li>Flexible working week</li>\n<li>Work from anywhere / work from home</li>\n<li>Pension Scheme</li>\n<li>Employee perks with 'Perkbox'</li>\n<li>28 days Holiday (plus 4 days at Christmas and New Year, AND your Birthday off - so 33 really)</li>\n<li>EMI Share Option Scheme (after qualifying length of service)</li>\n<li>Access to Mental Health Coach (who is just awesome)</li>\n<li>Lots of other benefits in the office (such as free breakfast, soda fridge, coffee machine, fortnightly lunches, ping pong to name but a few)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if all of this sounds like your cup of tea then just hit ‘Apply’ and get started… see you there!</p>\n<p>*Please note that the interview process for successful applicants will include a video-questionnaire and a technical test as well as video interview(s)</p>\n<p>Apply here via the <a href=\"https://ltpx.nl/EMV779L\"><strong>application form</strong></a>!</p>\n<p><em>Agency calls are not appreciated.</em><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6992f43c820fe84f7b2c675e5514cfe2345960a/68747470733a2f2f62636f6e74726f6c2e62726f636b6d657965722e6e6c2f747261636b2e7068703f6f7264657269643d313831363933\"></p>\n",

Of een app waarmee je je rekeningoverzichten van verschillende banken in één oogopslag kunt inzien? Als Java ontwikkelaar duik jij in innovaties die de financiële dienstverlening voor miljoenen klanten versnellen, verbeteren en vereenvoudigen. Dankzij jou hebben we een wendbaar applicatielandschap dat aan de backend op-en-top functioneert.</p>\n<p>Bij de Volksbank ontwikkelen we een groot deel van onze responsive webapplicaties zelf. Jij speelt hierin een belangrijke rol en ontwerpt, bouwt, test, beheert en documenteert je API’s, die er achter de schermen voor zorgen dat verschillende applicaties met elkaar kunnen communiceren. Hiervoor gebruik je onder meer innovatieve backend-technieken, microservices, container- en cloudtechnologieën en opensourcesoftware.</p>\n<p>In een multidisciplinair scrumteam werk je aan projecten die passen bij jouw ervaring, interesse en achtergrond. Denk aan applicaties voor de nieuwe Europese betaalwet PSD2, internetbankieren, iDeal, engines om processen te automatiseren of interne software voor medewerkers en adviseurs.

Dat ben jij in een notendop. Daarnaast beschik je over een kritische blik, het vermogen om complexe problemen te analyseren en de vindingrijkheid om eenvoudige creatieve oplossingen te bedenken. Nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen volg je op de voet, bijvoorbeeld doordat je onze lezingen, meet ups, pizzasessies en hackathons bijwoont. Natuurlijk deel je de kennis die je opdoet vervolgens graag met je collega's.</p>\n<p>Verder heb je:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HBO werk- en denkniveau</li>\n<li>Meerdere jaren ervaring met backend-ontwikkeling</li>\n<li>Ervaring met Java-frameworks, zoals Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring REST, JAX-RS, JAXB, JPA, JUnit en Mockito</li>\n<li>Kennis van onder meer IntelliJ of Eclipse, Maven, SQL Databases, Docker of Kubernetes en Git</li>\n<li>Bij voorkeur ervaring met frontend-technologieën</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Solliciteren?</h2>\n<p>Upload je motivatie en cv via deze link: <strong><a href=\"https://vonq.io/3bcksYE\">Klik hier om te solliciteren!</a></strong>\nWe nemen dan zo snel mogelijk contact met je op.

We likely work with your favorite publisher and handle over 3 billion events with 500M impressions a month.</p>\n<p>Our mission is to grow the podcast industry.

The benefit of joining a small team is you will have a tremendous impact on the company's direction and, to some extent, the industry.</p>\n<p>The podcasting industry has seen a lot of growth in the past few years, and we believe it has more room to grow. Beyond growth, podcasting presents some interesting problems: its decentralized, RSS-based nature, and the various ways people can listen. Joining Podsights is an excellent opportunity to be hands-on with an evolving medium.</p>\n<p>We believe that where you went to school has little bearing on your performance as a software engineer. Where you live isn't a proxy for talent. Your current employer provides low signal about your future potential.</p>\n<p>At Podsights, we look for ambition and curiosity. We love engineers that aren't solely interested in the craft of developing software. Want to start a company of your own one day? Yes, we want to talk. Are you interested in the business side of software? Tell us more.</p>\n<p>We want curious engineers. You take things apart and see how they work.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you will have 2+ years of experience as a software or data engineer.
